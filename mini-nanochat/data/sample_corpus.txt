Hello world! This is a test of the BPE tokenizer.
Hello everyone, welcome to the mini-nanochat project.
We are learning how transformers work from scratch.
This tokenizer uses byte pair encoding, or BPE for short.
BPE was originally designed for data compression in 1994.
It was later applied to neural machine translation in 2015.
GPT-2 introduced byte-level BPE in 2019.
Now we're implementing it ourselves to understand how it works.

Python is a great programming language.
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True

The function above prints hello world.
Functions in Python are defined with the def keyword.
They can return values using the return statement.

Machine learning models need lots of data.
Transformers use attention mechanisms.
Attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts.
The attention mechanism was introduced in 2017.
It revolutionized natural language processing.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
GPT-2 was released by OpenAI in 2019.
It showed that language models could be very capable.
GPT-3 scaled this up to 175 billion parameters.

Tokenization is the first step in processing text.
Good tokenization leads to better model performance.
Subword tokenization handles rare words gracefully.
BPE is one form of subword tokenization.
WordPiece and SentencePiece are alternatives.

The lazy dog slept under the tree.
The brown fox ran through the forest.
Quick movements catch the eye.
